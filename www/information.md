## Formula:

$$ \text{Amount of cannabinol  in mg} = \text{flower weight} \cdot \text{Cannabinol concentration} $$
 $$ \text{Cannabinol per mg/ml} = \frac{\text{Cannabinol in mg}}{\text{Alcohol in ml}} $$
 

### Example:

You have:
- 28g = **28000mg** of cannabis flowers
- they contain **10% CBD**
- **375ml of alcohol** as solvent
$$ \text{CBD amount} = 28000mg \cdot 0.1 = \text{2800mg of CBD} $$
$$ \text{For using 375ml of alcohol, youâ€™ll need to divide the total CBD amount by 375} $$
 $$ \frac{\text{2800 mg}}{\text{375 ml}} = \text{7.5 mg/ml (about 1 drop)} $$
